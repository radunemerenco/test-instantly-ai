# EPIC-001: AI-Powered Email App Development

## Epic Information
- **Epic ID**: EPIC-001
- **Title**: AI-Powered Email App Development
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 13 Story Points
- **Target Sprint**: Current (1-hour development window)

## Description
Develop a fully functional AI-powered email composition and management application within a 1-hour timeframe for the Instantly.AI interview assignment. This epic covers converting the existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript, implementing LangChain-powered AI agents for email generation, building a Material-UI frontend with email list and composition features, and establishing streaming communication between frontend and backend.

## Business Value
- **Interview Success**: Demonstrates full-stack development capabilities under time constraints
- **AI Integration**: Showcases LangChain agent implementation with proper routing logic
- **Technical Excellence**: Shows TypeScript proficiency and modern development practices
- **Product Completeness**: Delivers working MVP matching exact assignment requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete TypeScript conversion of both frontend and backend
- [ ] Functional AI router agent that classifies prompts as sales vs follow-up
- [ ] Two specialized agents generating appropriate email content with streaming responses
- [ ] Material-UI frontend with sidebar email list and compose form functionality
- [ ] End-to-end email creation, AI generation, and database storage working seamlessly

## Risks and Mitigations

### High Risk
- **Time Constraint Overrun**: 1-hour development window is extremely tight for full implementation
  - *Mitigation*: Prioritize core functionality over polish, use pre-built components, implement fallback simplified approaches

### Medium Risk
- **LangChain Integration Complexity**: First-time LangChain streaming implementation may consume excessive time
  - *Mitigation*: Prepare fallback to direct OpenAI API calls, keep agent logic simple, test streaming endpoint early

### Low Risk
- **TypeScript Conversion Issues**: Converting existing JavaScript may introduce type errors
  - *Mitigation*: Use minimal typing approach, leverage 'any' types for complex objects, focus on interface contracts

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [ ] Backend server starts successfully and responds to health checks
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully with proper schema
- [ ] Frontend builds and renders without console errors
- [ ] AI agents respond to prompts with appropriate email content
- [ ] Streaming functionality works between frontend and backend
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] QA validation completed

## Notes
- This epic is designed for rapid implementation under interview conditions
- Focus on demonstrating technical capability rather than production-ready code
- Document any shortcuts taken for potential discussion points
- Prepare to explain architectural decisions and trade-offs made under time pressure
