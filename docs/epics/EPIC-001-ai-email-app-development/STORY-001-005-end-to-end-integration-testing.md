# STORY-001-005: End-to-End Integration Testing

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: STORY-001-005
- **Epic**: [EPIC-001: AI-Powered Email App Development](README.md)
- **Title**: End-to-End Integration Testing
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimate**: 1 Story Points
- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Sprint**: Interview Assignment Sprint

## Description
Validate the complete email application workflow from composition through AI generation to database storage. This final story ensures all components work together seamlessly and identifies any integration issues before demo preparation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete email composition workflow functions without errors
- [ ] AI agent classification and generation work for both sales and follow-up scenarios
- [ ] Streaming functionality delivers content to frontend in real-time
- [ ] Database operations correctly store and retrieve generated emails
- [ ] Application runs reliably for demo presentation

## Subtasks

### 1. Workflow Testing
- [ ] Test complete email creation flow from start to finish
- [ ] Verify AI prompt classification accuracy with various inputs
- [ ] Validate streaming response delivery to frontend components
- [ ] Confirm database persistence of generated emails

### 2. Error Scenario Testing
- [ ] Test behavior with invalid AI prompts
- [ ] Verify handling of network connectivity issues
- [ ] Test database operation failures and recovery
- [ ] Validate frontend error states and user feedback

### 3. Performance Validation
- [ ] Measure AI response times for acceptable user experience
- [ ] Test streaming performance with various content lengths
- [ ] Verify database query performance with multiple emails
- [ ] Check memory usage and resource consumption

### 4. Verification
- [ ] Complete demo scenario preparation and testing
- [ ] Document any known limitations or issues
- [ ] Prepare explanation of technical decisions made
- [ ] Verify both development servers start reliably

## Technical Notes
- Focus on critical path functionality rather than comprehensive testing
- Document any shortcuts or compromises made due to time constraints
- Prepare talking points for interview discussion
- Ensure demo data is ready and application is stable

## Files to Verify
```
All files from previous stories should work together:
- Backend TypeScript conversion and compilation
- AI agent system with router and specialized agents
- Database operations with email CRUD functionality
- Frontend components with Material-UI interface
- Streaming integration between frontend and backend
```

## Demo Preparation Checklist
```
1. Both servers start without errors (frontend:3000, backend:3001)
2. Database migration completes successfully
3. Email list displays properly (even if empty)
4. Compose form accepts input in all fields
5. AI button opens prompt modal
6. Sample prompts generate appropriate emails:
   - "Sales pitch for new software tool"
   - "Follow up on last week's meeting"
7. Generated content streams into form fields
8. Emails save to database and appear in sidebar
9. Application performs smoothly during demo
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tested and functioning
- [ ] Critical error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Demo scenario runs reliably and smoothly
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable standards for presentation
- [ ] Documentation of any limitations prepared
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Dependencies
- STORY-001-001 (TypeScript Foundation Setup) - prerequisite
- STORY-001-002 (Backend AI Agent System) - prerequisite
- STORY-001-003 (Database Operations Enhancement) - prerequisite
- STORY-001-004 (Frontend Email Interface) - prerequisite

## Blockers
None identified

## Testing Notes
- Prepare multiple test scenarios for different email types
- Test with realistic prompts that demonstrate both agent types
- Verify error handling doesn't break the application flow
- Ensure demo can be completed within presentation timeframe
- Document any workarounds or manual steps required
