## Description
Build a complete Material-UI email management interface featuring an Apple Mail-style sidebar with email list, a comprehensive compose form with all required fields, and integrated AI-powered email generation with streaming text updates. This story creates the primary user interface for the email application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Apple Mail-style sidebar displaying email list with selection functionality
- [x] Email compose form with To, CC, BCC, Subject, and Body fields
- [x] AI button with modal prompt input for email generation
- [x] Streaming text integration that updates Subject and Body fields in real-time
- [x] Email editing capability after AI generation is complete

## Subtasks

### 1. Email List Sidebar Component
- [ ] Create EmailList component with Material-UI List and ListItem
- [ ] Implement email selection state management
- [ ] Add email preview display (sender, subject, date)
- [ ] Style sidebar to match Apple Mail aesthetic
- [ ] Handle empty state when no emails exist

### 2. Compose Form Component
- [ ] Build ComposeForm with all required input fields
- [ ] Implement form validation for required fields (To, Subject)
- [ ] Add Material-UI styling for professional appearance
- [ ] Create form state management with React hooks
- [ ] Add save/send functionality to store emails in database

### 3. AI Integration Component
- [ ] Create AI generation button with lightning icon
- [ ] Build modal dialog for AI prompt input
- [ ] Implement streaming text display in form fields
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling for AI requests
- [ ] Enable editing of generated content before saving

### 4. Verification
- [ ] Test complete email composition workflow
- [ ] Verify AI generation populates both subject and body
- [ ] Confirm email saving and retrieval from database
- [ ] Validate responsive design across screen sizes

## Technical Notes
- Use Material-UI components for consistent design
- Implement EventSource for streaming AI responses
- Keep component structure simple due to time constraints
- Use React hooks for state management instead of complex libraries
- Focus on core functionality over advanced features

## Files to Create
```
frontend/src/components/EmailList.tsx
frontend/src/components/ComposeForm.tsx
frontend/src/components/AIGenerationModal.tsx
frontend/src/hooks/useStreamingAI.ts
frontend/src/types/email.ts
frontend/src/utils/api.ts
```

## Component Structure
```typescript
// Main layout with sidebar and compose area
<Grid container>
  <Grid item xs={4}>
    <EmailList emails={emails} selectedId={selectedId} onSelect={setSelectedId} />
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={8}>
    <ComposeForm onSave={handleSave} onAIGenerate={handleAIGenerate} />
    <AIGenerationModal open={aiModalOpen} onGenerate={startAIGeneration} />
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```

## AI Integration Workflow
1. User clicks "AI âœ¨" button in compose form
2. Modal opens asking for email description
3. User enters prompt (e.g., "Meeting request for Tuesday")
4. Streaming starts, updating Subject field first
5. Body content streams in real-time
6. User can edit generated content
7. User saves email to database

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Email sidebar displays and allows selection of emails
- [ ] Compose form accepts all required input fields
- [ ] AI generation modal captures user prompts correctly
- [ ] Streaming text updates form fields in real-time
- [ ] Generated emails can be edited and saved successfully
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Dependencies
- STORY-001-001 (TypeScript Foundation Setup) - prerequisite
- STORY-001-002 (Backend AI Agent System) - prerequisite for streaming functionality
- STORY-001-003 (Database Operations Enhancement) - prerequisite for email storage

## Blockers
None identified

## Testing Notes
- Test email composition with various field combinations
- Verify AI generation works with different prompt types
- Test streaming performance with slow network conditions
- Validate form submission and email persistence
- Ensure responsive behavior on different screen sizes
